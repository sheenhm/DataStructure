# Homework #2
In homework #2, you are required to complete the Polynomial ADT using array. Complete `Poly.java`.

```agsl
package cse2010.hw2;

/**
* A Polynomial ADT
* DO NOT MODIFY!!
  */
  public interface Polynomial {
  /**
    * Returns the degree of this polynomial.
    * @return the degree of this polynomial
      */
      int degree();

  /**
    * Returns the number of terms in this polynomial.
    * @return the number of terms in this polynomial
      */
      int getTermCount();

  /**
    * Returns the coefficient of the term with the given exponent.
    * @param exponent the exponent
    * @return the coefficient of the term with the given exponent
      */
      int getCoefficient(int exponent);

  /**
    * Insert a new term into a given polynomial.
    * @param coef the coefficient
    * @param exponent the exponent
      */
      void addTerm(int coef, int exponent);

  /**
    * Returns a new polynomial that is the sum of this polynomial and the given polynomial.
    * @param rhs the given polynomial
    * @return a new polynomial that is the sum of this polynomial and the given polynomial
      */
      Polynomial add(Polynomial rhs);

  /**
    * Returns a new polynomial that is the product of this polynomial and the given polynomial.
    * @param rhs the given polynomial
    * @return a new polynomial that is the product of this polynomial and the given polynomial
      */
      Polynomial mult(Polynomial rhs);

  /**
    * Returns the value of this polynomial for the given value of x.
    * @param x the value of x
    * @return the value of this polynomial for the given value of x
      */
      double eval(double x);
      }
```

### Implementation Guidelines
* **Do not modify the signatures of any public methods.** However, you can freely modify any part of the code to complete your work.
* You should check the correctness of your program by running test code, `PolyTest.java`
